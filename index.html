    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Ellen Mae Nerosa, and I'm excited to introduce myself to you.</p>
       <p> I recently graduated with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, and I'm currently working as a part-time call center agent while pursuing my passion for programming. In my free time, I love to play the guitar, and I find it relaxing and therapeutic.</p>
        <p> I also enjoy exploring new technologies and learning new skills, which is why I'm currently enrolled in KodeGo's Full Stack Web Development program. As a freelancer, I'm always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise in the field of IT. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and I believe that programming is an excellent tool for achieving this goal.</p>
       <p> I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and programming. So if you have any questions or would like to chat, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
